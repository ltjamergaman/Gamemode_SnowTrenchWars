# Gamemode_SnowTrenchWars

Once the server has been created, you must put this into the console:
exec("Add-ons/Gamemode_SnowTrenchWars/Trench Digging/server.cs");

This loads the trench digging of the dirt stuff becasue for some reason when I made this add-on 10 years ago, I couldn't get this to execute with server creation like normal without crashing. I'll probably fix it later, who knows.

Once you create a Slayer Minigame, you'll need to start the Player Bonus Setback system. Put this in the console:
STW_StartPBS();

Open the Gamemode.txt and you'll find all the add-ons you need to play the gamemode.
You will also need Client_SnowTrenchWars.zip
